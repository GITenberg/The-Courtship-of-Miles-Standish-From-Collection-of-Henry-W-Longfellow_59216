<div class="verse">To and fro in a room of his simple and primitive dwelling,</div>
<div class="verse">Clad in doublet and hose, and boots of Cordovan leather,</div>
<div class="verse">Strode, with a martial air, Miles Standish the Puritan Captain.</div>
<div class="verse">Buried in thought he seemed, with his hands behind him, and pausing</div>
<div class="verse">Ever and anon to behold his glittering weapons of warfare,</div>
<div class="verse">Hanging in shining array along the walls of the chamber,&mdash;</div>

<div class="verse">Cutlass and corslet of steel, and his trusty sword of Damascus,</div>
<div class="verse">Curved at the point and inscribed with its mystical Arabic sentence,</div>
<div class="verse">While underneath, in a corner, were fowling-piece, musket, and matchlock.</div>
<div class="verse">Short of stature he was, but strongly built and athletic.</div>
<div class="verse">Broad in the shoulders, deep-chested, with muscles and sinews of iron;</div>
<div class="verse">Brown as a nut was his face, but his russet beard was already</div>
<div class="verse">Flaked with patches of snow, as hedges sometimes in November.</div>
<div class="verse">Near him was seated John Alden, his friend, and household companion,</div>
<div class="verse">Writing with diligent speed at a table of pine by the window;</div>
<div class="verse">Fair-haired, azure-eyed, with delicate Saxon complexion,</div>
<div class="verse">Having the dew of his youth, and the beauty thereof, as the captives</div>
<div class="verse">Whom Saint Gregory saw, and exclaimed, &#8220;Not Angles but Angels.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Youngest of all was he of the men who came in the May Flower.</div>

<div class="indent">Suddenly breaking the silence, the diligent scribe interrupting,</div>
<div class="verse">Spake, in the pride of his heart, Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Look at these arms,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the warlike weapons that hang here</div>
<div class="verse">Burnished and bright and clean, as if for parade or inspection!</div>
<div class="verse">This is the sword of Damascus I fought with in Flanders; this breastplate,</div>
<div class="verse">Well I remember the day! once saved my life in a skirmish;</div>
<div class="verse">Here in front you can see the very dint of the bullet</div>
<div class="verse">Fired point-blank at my heart by a Spanish arcabucero.</div>
<div class="verse">Had it not been of sheer steel, the forgotten bones of Miles Standish</div>
<div class="verse">Would at this moment be mould, in their grave in the Flemish morasses.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered John Alden, but looked not up from his writing:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Truly the breath of the Lord hath slackened the speed of the bullet;</div>
<div class="verse">He in his mercy preserved you, to be our shield and our weapon!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Still the Captain continued, unheeding the words of the stripling:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;See, how bright they are burnished, as if in an arsenal hanging;</div>
<div class="verse">That is because I have done it myself, and not left it to others.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Serve yourself, would you be well served, is an excellent adage;</div>
<div class="verse">So I take care of my arms, as you of your pens and your ink-horn.</div>
<div class="verse">Then, too, there are my soldiers, my great, invincible army,</div>
<div class="verse">Twelve men, all equipped, having each his rest and his matchlock,</div>
<div class="verse">Eighteen shillings a month, together with diet and pillage,</div>
<div class="verse">And, like Cæsar, I know the name of each of my soldiers!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">This he said with a smile, that danced in his eyes, as the sunbeams</div>
<div class="verse">Dance on the waves of the sea, and vanish again in a moment.</div>
<div class="verse">Alden laughed as he wrote, and still the Captain continued:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Look! you can see from this window my brazen howitzer planted</div>
<div class="verse">High on the roof of the church, a preacher who speaks to the purpose,</div>
<div class="verse">Steady, straight-forward, and strong, with irresistible logic,</div>
<div class="verse">Orthodox, flashing conviction right into the hearts of the heathen.</div>
<div class="verse">Now we are ready, I think, for any assault of the Indians;</div>
<div class="verse">Let them come, if they like, and the sooner they try it the better,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Let them come if they like, be it sagamore, sachem, or pow-wow,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Long at the window he stood, and wistfully gazed on the landscape,</div>
<div class="verse">Washed with a cold grey mist, the vapory breath of the east-wind.</div>
<div class="verse">Forest and meadow and hill, and the steel-blue rim of the ocean,</div>
<div class="verse">Lying silent and sad, in the afternoon shadows and sunshine.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Over his countenance flitted a shadow like those on the landscape,</div>
<div class="verse">Gloom intermingled with light; and his voice was subdued with emotion,</div>
<div class="verse">Tenderness, pity, regret, as after a pause he proceeded:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Yonder there, on the hill by the sea, lies buried Rose Standish;</div>
<div class="verse">Beautiful rose of love, that bloomed for me by the wayside!</div>
<div class="verse">She was the first to die of all who came in the May Flower!</div>
<div class="verse">Green above her is growing the field of wheat we have sown there,</div>
<div class="verse">Better to hide from the Indian scouts the graves of our people,</div>
<div class="verse">Lest they should count them and see how many already have perished!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Sadly his face he averted, and strode up and down, and was thoughtful.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Fixed to the opposite wall was a shelf of books, and among them</div>
<div class="verse">Prominent three, distinguished alike for bulk and for binding;</div>
<div class="verse">Bariffe&#8217;s Artillery Guide, and the Commentaries of Cæsar,</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the Latin translated by Arthur Goldinge of London,</div>
<div class="verse">And, as if guarded by these, between them was standing the Bible.</div>
<div class="verse">Musing a moment before them, Miles Standish paused, as if doubtful</div>
<div class="verse">Which of the three he should choose for his consolation and comfort,</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="verse">Finally down from its shelf he dragged the ponderous Roman,</div>
<div class="verse">Seated himself at the window, and opened the book, and in silence</div>
<div class="verse">Turned o&#8217;er the well-worn leaves, where thumb-marks thick on the margin,</div>
<div class="verse">Like the trample of feet, proclaimed the battle was hottest.</div>
<div class="verse">Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling,</div>
<div class="verse">Busily writing epistles important, to go by the May Flower,</div>
<div class="verse">Ready to sail on the morrow, or next day at latest, God willing!</div>
<div class="verse">Homeward bound with the tidings of all that terrible winter,</div>
<div class="verse">Letters written by Alden, and full of the name of Priscilla,</div>
<div class="verse">Full of the name and the fame of the Puritan maiden Priscilla!</div>

<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling,</div>
<div class="verse">Or an occasional sigh from the labouring heart of the Captain,</div>
<div class="verse">Reading the marvellous words and achievements of Julius Cæsar.</div>
<div class="verse">After a while he exclaimed, as he smote with his hand, palm downwards.</div>
<div class="verse">Heavily on the page: &#8220;A wonderful man was this Cæsar!</div>
<div class="verse">You are a writer, and I am a fighter, but here is a fellow</div>
<div class="verse">Who could both write and fight, and in both was equally skilful!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Straightway answered and spake John Alden, the comely, the youthful:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Yes, he was equally skilled, as you say, with his pen and his weapons.</div>
<div class="verse">Somewhere have I read, but where I forget, he could dictate</div>
<div class="verse">Seven letters at once, at the same time writing his memoirs.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Truly,&#8221; continued the Captain, not heeding or hearing the other,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Truly a wonderful man was Caius Julius Cæsar!</div>
<div class="verse">Better be first, he said, in a little Iberian village,</div>
<div class="verse">Than be second in Rome, and I think he was right when he said it.</div>
<div class="verse">Twice was he married before he was twenty, and many times after;</div>
<div class="verse">Battles five hundred he fought, and a thousand cities he conquered;</div>
<div class="verse">He, too, fought in Flanders, as he himself has recorded;</div>
<div class="verse">Finally he was stabbed by his friend, the orator Brutus!</div>
<div class="verse">Now, do you know what he did on a certain occasion in Flanders,</div>
<div class="verse">When the rear-guard of his army retreated, the front giving way too,</div>
<div class="verse">And the immortal Twelfth Legion was crowded so closely together</div>
<div class="verse">There was no room for their swords? Why, he seized a shield from a soldier,</div>
<div class="verse">Put himself straight at the head of his troops and commanded the captains,</div>
<div class="verse">Calling on each by his name, to order forward the ensigns;</div>
<div class="verse">Then to widen the ranks, and give more room for their weapons;</div>
<div class="verse">So he won the day, the battle of something-or-other.</div>
<div class="verse">That&#8217;s what I always say; if you wish a thing to be well done,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">All was silent again; the Captain continued his reading.</div>
<div class="verse">Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling</div>
<div class="verse">Writing epistles important to go next day by the May Flower,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Filled with the name and the fame of the Puritan maiden Priscilla;</div>
<div class="verse">Every sentence began or closed with the name of Priscilla,</div>
<div class="verse">Till the treacherous pen, to which he confided the secret,</div>
<div class="verse">Strove to betray it by singing and shouting the name of Priscilla!</div>
<div class="verse">Finally closing his book, with a bang of the ponderous cover,</div>
<div class="verse">Sudden and loud as the sound of a soldier grounding his musket,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus to the young man spake Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;When you have finished your work, I have something important to tell you.</div>
<div class="verse">Be not however in haste; I can wait; I shall not be impatient!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Straightway Alden replied, as he folded the last of his letters,</div>
<div class="verse">Pushing his papers aside, and giving respectful attention:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Speak; for whenever you speak, I am always ready to listen,</div>
<div class="verse">Always ready to hear whatever pertains to Miles Standish.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered the Captain, embarrassed, and culling his phrases:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;&#8217;Tis not good for a man to be alone, say the Scriptures.</div>
<div class="verse">This I have said before, and again and again I repeat it;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Every hour in the day, I think it, and feel it, and say it.</div>
<div class="verse">Since Rose Standish died, my life has been weary and dreary;</div>
<div class="verse">Sick at heart have I been, beyond the healing of friendship.</div>
<div class="verse">Oft in my lonely hours have I thought of the maiden Priscilla.</div>
<div class="verse">She is alone in the world; her father and mother and brother</div>
<div class="verse">Died in the winter together; I saw her going and coming,</div>
<div class="verse">Now to the grave of the dead, and now to the bed of the dying,</div>
<div class="verse">Patient, courageous, and strong, and said to myself, that if ever</div>
<div class="verse">There were angels on earth, as there are angels in heaven,</div>
<div class="verse">Two have I seen and known; and the angel whose name is Priscilla</div>
<div class="verse">Holds in my desolate life the place which the other abandoned.</div>
<div class="verse">Long have I cherished the thought, but never have dared to reveal it,</div>
<div class="verse">Being a coward in this, though valiant enough in the most part.</div>
<div class="verse">Go to the damsel Priscilla, the loveliest maiden of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Say that a blunt old Captain, a man not of words but of actions,</div>
<div class="verse">Offers his hand and his heart, the hand and heart of a soldier.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Not in these words, you know, but this in short is my meaning;</div>
<div class="verse">I am a maker of war, and not a maker of phrases.</div>
<div class="verse">You, who are bred as a scholar, can say it in elegant language,</div>
<div class="verse">Such as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of lovers,</div>
<div class="verse">Such as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">When he had spoken, John Alden, the fair haired, taciturn stripling,</div>
<div class="verse">All aghast at his words, surprised, embarrassed bewildered,</div>
<div class="verse">Trying to mask his dismay by treating the subject with lightness,</div>
<div class="verse">Trying to smile, and yet feeling his heart stand still in his bosom,</div>
<div class="verse">Just as a timepiece stops in a house that is stricken by lightning,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus made answer and spake, or rather stammered than answered:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Such a message as that, I am sure I should mangle and mar it:</div>
<div class="verse">If you would have it well done,&mdash;I am only repeating your maxim,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">You must do it yourself, you must not leave it to others!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">But with the air of a man whom nothing can turn from his purpose.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Gravely shaking his head, made answer the Captain of Plymouth:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Truly the maxim is good, and I do not mean to gainsay it;</div>
<div class="verse">But we must use it discreetly, and not waste powder for nothing.</div>
<div class="verse">Now, as I said before, I was never a maker of phrases.</div>
<div class="verse">I can march up to a fortress and summon the place to surrender,</div>
<div class="verse">But march up to a woman with such a proposal, I dare not.</div>
<div class="verse">I&#8217;m not afraid of bullets, nor shot from the mouth of a cannon,</div>
<div class="verse">But of a thundering &#8216;No!&#8217; point-blank from the mouth of a woman,</div>
<div class="verse">That I confess I&#8217;m afraid of, nor am I ashamed to confess it!</div>
<div class="verse">So you must grant my request, for you are an elegant scholar,</div>
<div class="verse">Having the graces of speech, and skill in the turning of phrases.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Taking the hand of his friend, who still was reluctant and doubtful,</div>
<div class="verse">Holding it long in his own, and pressing it kindly, he added:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Though I have spoken thus lightly, yet deep is the feeling that prompts me;</div>
<div class="verse">Surely you cannot refuse what I ask in the name of our friendship!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Then made answer John Alden: &#8220;The name of friendship is sacred;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
<div class="verse">What you demand in that name, I have not the power to deny you!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">So the strong will prevailed, subduing and moulding the gentler,</div>
<div class="verse">Friendship prevailed over love, and Alden went on his errand.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">So</span> the strong will prevailed, and Alden went on his errand,</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the street of the village, and into the paths of the forest,</div>
<div class="verse">Into the tranquil woods, where blue-birds and robins were building</div>
<div class="verse">Towns in the populous trees, with hanging gardens of verdure,</div>
<div class="verse">Peaceful, aerial cities of joy and affection and freedom.</div>
<div class="verse">All around him was calm, but within him commotion and conflict,</div>
<div class="verse">Love contending with friendship, and self with each generous impulse.</div>
<div class="verse">To and fro in his breast his thoughts were heaving and dashing,</div>
<div class="verse">As in a foundering ship, with every roll of the vessel,</div>
<div class="verse">Washes the bitter sea, the merciless surge of the ocean!</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Must I relinquish it all,&#8221; he cried with a wild lamentation,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Must I relinquish it all, the joy, the hope, the illusion?</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Was it for this I have loved, and waited, and worshipped in silence?</div>
<div class="verse">Was it for this I have followed the flying feet and the shadow</div>
<div class="verse">Over the wintry sea, to the desolate shores of New England?</div>
<div class="verse">Truly the heart is deceitful, and out of its depths of corruption</div>
<div class="verse">Rise, like an exhalation, the misty phantoms of passion;</div>
<div class="verse">Angels of light they seem, but are only delusions of Satan.</div>
<div class="verse">All is clear to me now; I feel it, I see it distinctly!</div>
<div class="verse">This is the hand of the Lord; it is laid upon me in anger,</div>
<div class="verse">For I have followed too much the heart&#8217;s desires and devices,</div>
<div class="verse">Worshipping Astaroth blindly, and impious idols of Baal.</div>
<div class="verse">This is the cross I must bear; the sin and the swift retribution.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand;</div>
<div class="verse">Crossing the brook at the ford, where it brawled over pebble and shadow,</div>
<div class="verse">Gathering still, as he went, the May-flowers blooming around him,</div>
<div class="verse">Fragrant, filling the air with a strange and wonderful sweetness</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Children lost in the woods, and covered with leaves in their slumber.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Puritan flowers,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the type of Puritan maidens,</div>
<div class="verse">Modest and simple and sweet, the very type of Priscilla!</div>
<div class="verse">So I will take them to her; to Priscilla the May-flower of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Modest and simple and sweet, as a parting gift will I take them;</div>
<div class="verse">Breathing their silent farewells, as they fade and wither and perish,</div>
<div class="verse">Soon to be thrown away as is the heart of the giver.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand;</div>
<div class="verse">Came to an open space, and saw the disk of the ocean,</div>
<div class="verse">Sail-less, sombre, and cold with the comfortless breath of the east-wind;</div>
<div class="verse">Saw the new-built house, and people at work in a meadow;</div>
<div class="verse">Heard, as he drew near the door, the musical voice of Priscilla</div>
<div class="verse">Singing the hundredth Psalm, the grand old Puritan anthem,</div>
<div class="verse">Music that Luther sang to the sacred words of the Psalmist,</div>
<div class="verse">Full of the breath of the Lord, consoling and comforting many.</div>
<div class="verse">Then, as he opened the door, he beheld the form of the maiden</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Seated beside her wheel, and the carded wool like a snow-drift</div>
<div class="verse">Piled at her knee, her white hands feeding the ravenous spindle,</div>
<div class="verse">While with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel in its motion.</div>
<div class="verse">Open wide on her lap lay the well-worn psalm book of Ainsworth,</div>
<div class="verse">Printed in Amsterdam, the words and the music together,</div>
<div class="verse">Rough-hewn, angular notes, like stones in the wall of a churchyard,</div>
<div class="verse">Darkened and overhung by the running vine of the verses.</div>
<div class="verse">Such was the book from whose pages she sang the old Puritan anthem,</div>
<div class="verse">She, the Puritan girl, in the solitude of the forest,</div>
<div class="verse">Making the humble house and the modest apparel of homespun</div>
<div class="verse">Beautiful with her beauty, and rich with the wealth of her being!</div>
<div class="verse">Over him rushed, like a wind that is keen and cold and relentless,</div>
<div class="verse">Thoughts of what might have been, and the weight and woe of his errand;</div>
<div class="verse">All the dreams that had faded, and all the hopes that had vanished,</div>
<div class="verse">All his life henceforth a dreary and tenantless mansion,</div>
<div class="verse">Haunted by vain regrets, and pallid, sorrowful faces.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Still he said to himself, and almost fiercely he said it,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Let not him that putteth his hand to the plough look backwards;</div>
<div class="verse">Though the ploughshare cut through the flowers of life to its fountains,</div>
<div class="verse">Though it pass o&#8217;er the graves of the dead and the hearths of the living,</div>
<div class="verse">It is the will of the Lord; and his mercy endureth for ever!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">So he entered the house: and the hum of the wheel and the singing</div>
<div class="verse">Suddenly ceased; for Priscilla, aroused by his step on the threshold,</div>
<div class="verse">Rose as he entered, and gave him her hand, in signal of welcome,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, &#8220;I knew it was you, when I heard your step in the passage;</div>
<div class="verse">For I was thinking of you, as I sat there singing and spinning.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Awkward and dumb with delight, that a thought of him had been mingled</div>
<div class="verse">Thus in the sacred psalm, that came from the heart of the maiden,</div>
<div class="verse">Silent before her he stood, and gave her the flowers for an answer,</div>
<div class="verse">Finding no words for his thought. He remembered that day in the winter,</div>
<div class="verse">After the first great snow, when he broke a path from the village,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Reeling and plunging along through the drifts that encumbered the doorway,</div>
<div class="verse">Stamping the snow from his feet as he entered the house, and Priscilla</div>
<div class="verse">Laughed at his snowy locks, and gave him a seat by the fire-side,</div>
<div class="verse">Grateful and pleased to know he had thought of her in the snow-storm.</div>
<div class="verse">Had he but spoken then! perhaps not in vain had he spoken;</div>
<div class="verse">Now it was all too late; the golden moment had vanished!</div>
<div class="verse">So he stood there abashed, and gave her the flowers for an answer.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Then they sat down and talked of the birds and the beautiful Spring-time,</div>
<div class="verse">Talked of their friends at home, and the May Flower that sailed on the morrow.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I have been thinking all day,&#8221; said gently the Puritan maiden,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Dreaming all night, and thinking all day, of the hedge-rows of England,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">They are in blossom now, and the country is all like a garden;</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking of lanes and fields, and the song of the lark and the linnet,</div>
<div class="verse">Seeing the village street, and familiar faces of neighbours</div>
<div class="verse">Going about as of old, and stopping to gossip together,</div>

<div class="verse">And, at the end of the street, the village church, with the ivy</div>
<div class="verse">Climbing the old grey tower, and the quiet graves in the churchyard.</div>
<div class="verse">Kind are the people I live with, and dear to me, my religion;</div>
<div class="verse">Still my heart is so sad, that I wish myself back in Old England.</div>
<div class="verse">You will say it is wrong, but I cannot help it: I almost</div>
<div class="verse">Wish myself back in Old England, I feel so lonely and wretched.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Thereupon answered the youth:&mdash;&#8220;Indeed I do not condemn you,</div>
<div class="verse">Stouter hearts than a woman&#8217;s have quailed in this terrible winter.</div>
<div class="verse">Yours is tender and trusting, and needs a stronger to lean on;</div>
<div class="verse">So I have come to you now, with an offer and proffer of marriage</div>
<div class="verse">Made by a good man and true, Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Thus he delivered his message, the dextrous writer of letters,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Did not embellish the theme, nor array it in beautiful phrases,</div>
<div class="verse">But came straight to the point, and blurted it out like a school-boy;</div>
<div class="verse">Even the Captain himself could hardly have said it more bluntly.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Mute with amazement and sorrow, Priscilla the Puritan maiden</div>
<div class="verse">Looked into Alden&#8217;s face, her eyes dilated with wonder,</div>
<div class="verse">Feeling his words like a blow, that stunned her and rendered her speechless;</div>
<div class="verse">Till at length she exclaimed, interrupting the ominous silence:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;If the great Captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me,</div>
<div class="verse">Why does he not come himself, and take the trouble to woo me?</div>
<div class="verse">If I am not worth the wooing, I surely am not worth the winning!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Then John Alden began explaining and smoothing the matter,</div>
<div class="verse">Making it worse as he went, by saying the Captain was busy,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Had no time for such things;&mdash;such things! the words grating harshly</div>
<div class="verse">Fell on the ear of Priscilla; and swift as a flash she made answer:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Has he no time for such things, as you call it, before he is married.</div>
<div class="verse">Would he be likely to find it, or make it, after the wedding?</div>
<div class="verse">That is the way with you men; you don&#8217;t understand us, you cannot.</div>
<div class="verse">When you have made up your minds, after thinking of this one and that one,</div>
<div class="verse">Choosing, selecting, rejecting, comparing one with another,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Then you make known your desire, with abrupt and sudden avowal,</div>
<div class="verse">And are offended and hurt, and indignant perhaps, that a woman</div>
<div class="verse">Does not respond at once to a love that she never suspected,</div>
<div class="verse">Does not attain at a bound the height to which you have been climbing.</div>
<div class="verse">This is not right nor just: for surely a woman&#8217;s affection</div>
<div class="verse">Is not a thing to be asked for, and had for only the asking.</div>
<div class="verse">When one is truly in love, one not only says it, but shows it.</div>
<div class="verse">Had he but waited awhile, had he only showed that he loved me,</div>
<div class="verse">Even this Captain of yours&mdash;who knows?&mdash;at last might have won me,</div>
<div class="verse">Old and rough as he is; but now it never can happen.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Still John Alden went on, unheeding the words of Priscilla,</div>
<div class="verse">Urging the suit of his friend, explaining, persuading, expanding;</div>
<div class="verse">Spoke of his courage and skill, and of all his battles in Flanders,</div>
<div class="verse">How with the people of God he had chosen to suffer affliction,</div>
<div class="verse">How, in return for his zeal, they had made him Captain of Plymouth;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
<div class="verse">He was a gentleman born, could trace his pedigree plainly</div>
<div class="verse">Back to Hugh Standish of Duxbury Hall, in Lancashire, England,</div>
<div class="verse">Who was the son of Ralph, and the grandson of Thurston de Standish;</div>
<div class="verse">Heir unto vast estates, of which he was basely defrauded,</div>
<div class="verse">Still bore the family arms, and had for his crest a cock argent</div>
<div class="verse">Combed and wattled gules, and all the rest of the blazon.</div>
<div class="verse">He was a man of honour, of noble and generous nature;</div>
<div class="verse">Though he was rough, he was kindly; she knew how during the winter</div>
<div class="verse">He had attended the sick, with a hand as gentle as woman&#8217;s;</div>
<div class="verse">Somewhat hasty and hot, he could not deny it, and headstrong,</div>
<div class="verse">Stern as a soldier might be, but hearty, and placable always,</div>
<div class="verse">Not to be laughed at and scorned, because he was little of stature;</div>
<div class="verse">For he was great of heart, magnanimous, courtly, courageous;</div>
<div class="verse">Any woman in Plymouth, nay, any woman in England,</div>
<div class="verse">Might be happy and proud to be called the wife of Miles Standish!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<div class="indent">But as he warmed and glowed, in his simple and eloquent language,</div>
<div class="verse">Quite forgetful of self, and full of the praise of his rival,</div>
<div class="verse">Archly the maiden smiled, and, with eyes overrunning with laughter,</div>
<div class="verse">Said, in a tremulous voice, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you speak for yourself, John?&#8221;</div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">Into</span> the open air John Alden, perplexed and bewildered,</div>
<div class="verse">Rushed like a man insane, and wandered alone by the seaside;</div>
<div class="verse">Paced up and down the sands, and bared his head to the east-wind,</div>
<div class="verse">Cooling his heated brow, and the fire and fever within him.</div>
<div class="verse">Slowly as out of the heavens, with apocalyptical splendours,</div>
<div class="verse">Sank the City of God, in the vision of John the Apostle,</div>
<div class="verse">So, with its cloudy walls of chrysolite, jasper, and sapphire,</div>
<div class="verse">Sank the broad red sun, and over its turrets uplifted</div>
<div class="verse">Glimmered the golden reed of the angel who measured the city.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">&#8220;Welcome, O wind of the East!&#8221; he exclaimed in his wild exultation,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Welcome, O wind of the East, from the caves of the misty Atlantic!</div>
<div class="verse">Blowing o&#8217;er fields of dulse, and measureless meadows of sea-grass,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Blowing o&#8217;er rocky wastes, and the grottoes and gardens of ocean!</div>
<div class="verse">Lay thy cold, moist hand on my burning forehead, and wrap me</div>
<div class="verse">Close in thy garments of mist, to allay the fever within me!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Like an awakened conscience, the sea was moaning and tossing</div>
<div class="verse">Beating remorseful and loud the mutable sands of the sea-shore.</div>
<div class="verse">Fierce in his soul was the struggle and tumult of passions contending;</div>
<div class="verse">Love triumphant and crowned, and friendship wounded and bleeding,</div>
<div class="verse">Passionate cries of desire, and importunate pleadings of duty!</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Is it my fault,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that the maiden has chosen between us?</div>
<div class="verse">Is it my fault that he failed,&mdash;my fault that I am the victor?&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Then within him there thundered a voice, like the voice of the Prophet:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;It hath displeased the Lord!&#8221;&mdash;and he thought of David&#8217;s transgression,</div>
<div class="verse">Bathsheba&#8217;s beautiful face, and his friend in the front of the battle!</div>
<div class="verse">Shame and confusion of guilt, and abasement and self-condemnation,</div>
<div class="verse">Overwhelmed him at once; and he cried in the deepest contrition:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;It hath displeased the Lord! It is the temptation of Satan!&#8221;</div>

<div class="indent">Then, uplifting his head, he looked at the sea, and beheld there</div>
<div class="verse">Dimly the shadowy form of the May Flower riding at anchor,</div>
<div class="verse">Rocked on the rising tide, and ready to sail on the morrow;</div>
<div class="verse">Heard the voices of men through the mist, the rattle of cordage</div>
<div class="verse">Thrown on the deck, the shouts of the mate, and the sailors&#8217; &#8220;Ay, ay, Sir!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Clear and distinct, but not loud, in the dripping air of the twilight.</div>
<div class="verse">Still for a moment he stood, and listened, and stared at the vessel,</div>
<div class="verse">Then went hurriedly on, as one who, seeing a phantom,</div>
<div class="verse">Stops, then quickens his pace, and follows the beckoning shadow.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Yes, it is plain to me now,&#8221; he murmured; &#8220;the hand of the Lord is</div>
<div class="verse">Leading me out of the land of darkness, the bondage of error,</div>
<div class="verse">Through the sea, that shall lift the walls of its waters around me,</div>
<div class="verse">Hiding me, cutting me off, from the cruel thoughts that pursue me.</div>
<div class="verse">Back will I go o&#8217;er the ocean, this dreary land will abandon,</div>
<div class="verse">Her whom I may not love, and him whom my heart has offended.</div>
<div class="verse">Better to be in my grave in the green old churchyard in England,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Close by my mother&#8217;s side, and among the dust of my kindred;</div>
<div class="verse">Better be dead and forgotten, than living in shame and dishonour!</div>
<div class="verse">Sacred and safe and unseen, in the dark of the narrow chamber</div>
<div class="verse">With me my secret shall lie, like a buried jewel that glimmers</div>
<div class="verse">Bright on the hand that is dust, in the chambers of silence and darkness,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, as the marriage ring of the great espousal hereafter!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Thus as he spake, he turned, in the strength of his strong resolution,</div>
<div class="verse">Leaving behind him the shore, and hurried along in the twilight,</div>
<div class="verse">Through the congenial gloom of the forest silent and sombre,</div>
<div class="verse">Till he beheld the lights in the seven houses of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Shining like seven stars in the dusk and mist of the evening.</div>
<div class="verse">Soon he entered his door, and found the redoubtable Captain</div>
<div class="verse">Sitting alone, and absorbed in the martial pages of Cæsar,</div>
<div class="verse">Fighting some great campaign in Hainault or Brabant or Flanders.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Long have you been on your errand,&#8221; he said with a cheery demeanour,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Even as one who is waiting an answer, and fears not the issue.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Not far off is the house, although the woods are between us;</div>
<div class="verse">But you have lingered so long, that while you were going and coming</div>
<div class="verse">I have fought ten battles and sacked and demolished a city.</div>
<div class="verse">Come, sit down, and in order relate to me all that has happened.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Then John Alden spake, and related the wondrous adventure,</div>
<div class="verse">From beginning to end, minutely, just as it happened;</div>
<div class="verse">How he had seen Priscilla, and how he had sped in his courtship,</div>
<div class="verse">Only smoothing a little, and softening down her refusal.</div>
<div class="verse">But when he came at length to the words Priscilla had spoken,</div>
<div class="verse">Words so tender and cruel: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you speak for yourself, John?&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Up leaped the Captain of Plymouth, and stamped on the floor, till his armour</div>
<div class="verse">Clanged on the wall, where it hung, with a sound of sinister omen.</div>
<div class="verse">All his pent-up wrath burst forth in a sudden explosion,</div>
<div class="verse">Even as a hand-grenade, that scatters destruction around it.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Wildly he shouted, and loud: &#8220;John Alden! you have betrayed me!</div>
<div class="verse">Me, Miles Standish, your friend! have supplanted, defrauded, betrayed me!</div>
<div class="verse">One of my ancestors ran his sword through the heart of Wat Tyler;</div>
<div class="verse">Who shall prevent me from running my own through the heart of a traitor?</div>
<div class="verse">Yours is the greater treason, for yours is a treason to friendship!</div>
<div class="verse">You, who lived under my roof, whom I cherished and loved as a brother;</div>
<div class="verse">You, who have fed at my board, and drunk at my cup, to whose keeping</div>
<div class="verse">I have intrusted my honour, my thoughts the most sacred and secret,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">You too, Brutus! ah woe to the name of friendship hereafter!</div>
<div class="verse">Brutus was Cæsar&#8217;s friend, and you were mine, but henceforward</div>
<div class="verse">Let there be nothing between us save war, and implacable hatred!&#8221;</div>

<div class="indent">So spake the Captain of Plymouth, and strode about in the chamber,</div>
<div class="verse">Chafing and choking with rage; like cords were the veins on his temples.</div>
<div class="verse">But in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway,</div>
<div class="verse">Bringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Rumours of danger and war and hostile incursions of Indians!</div>
<div class="verse">Straightway the Captain paused, and, without further question or parley,</div>
<div class="verse">Took from the nail on the wall his sword, with its scabbard of iron,</div>
<div class="verse">Buckled the belt round his waist, and, frowning fiercely, departed.</div>
<div class="verse">Alden was left alone. He heard the clank of the scabbard</div>
<div class="verse">Growing fainter and fainter, and dying away in the distance.</div>
<div class="verse">Then he arose from his seat, and looked forth into the darkness,</div>
<div class="verse">Felt the cool air blow on his cheek, that was hot with the insult,</div>
<div class="verse">Lifted his eyes to the heavens, and, folding his hands as in childhood,</div>
<div class="verse">Prayed in the silence of night to the Father who seeth in secret.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Meanwhile the choleric Captain strode wrathful away to the council,</div>
<div class="verse">Found it already assembled, impatiently waiting his coming;</div>
<div class="verse">Men in the middle of life, austere and grave in deportment,</div>
<div class="verse">Only one of them old, the hill that was nearest to heaven,</div>
<div class="verse">Covered with snow, but erect, the excellent Elder of Plymouth.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
<div class="verse">God had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting,</div>
<div class="verse">Then had sifted the wheat, as the living seed of a nation;</div>
<div class="verse">So say the chronicles old, and such is the faith of the people!</div>
<div class="verse">Near them was standing an Indian, in attitude stern and defiant,</div>
<div class="verse">Naked down to the waist, and grim and ferocious in aspect;</div>
<div class="verse">While on the table before them was lying unopened a Bible,</div>
<div class="verse">Ponderous, bound in leather, brass-studded, printed in Holland,</div>
<div class="verse">And beside it outstretched the skin of a rattlesnake glittered,</div>
<div class="verse">Filled, like a quiver, with arrows; a signal and challenge of warfare,</div>
<div class="verse">Brought by the Indian, and speaking with arrowy tongues of defiance.</div>
<div class="verse">This Miles Standish beheld, as he entered, and heard them debating</div>
<div class="verse">What were an answer befitting the hostile message and menace,</div>
<div class="verse">Talking of this and of that, contriving, suggesting, objecting;</div>
<div class="verse">One voice only for peace, and that the voice of the Elder,</div>
<div class="verse">Judging it wise and well that some at least were converted,</div>
<div class="verse">Rather than any were slain, for this was but Christian behavior!</div>

<div class="verse">Then outspake Miles Standish, the stalwart Captain of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Muttering deep in his throat, for his voice was husky with anger,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;What! do you mean to make war with milk and the water of roses?</div>
<div class="verse">Is it to shoot red squirrels you have your howitzer planted</div>
<div class="verse">There on the roof of the church, or is it to shoot red devils?</div>
<div class="verse">Truly the only tongue that is understood by a savage</div>
<div class="verse">Must be the tongue of fire that speaks from the mouth of the cannon!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered and said the excellent Elder of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Somewhat amazed and alarmed at this irreverent language:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Not so thought Saint Paul, nor yet the other Apostles;</div>
<div class="verse">Not from the cannon&#8217;s mouth were the tongues of fire they spake with!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">But unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the Captain,</div>
<div class="verse">Who had advanced to the table, and thus continued discoursing:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Leave this matter to me, for to me by right it pertaineth.</div>
<div class="verse">War is a terrible trade; but in the cause that is righteous,</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet is the smell of powder; and thus I answer the challenge!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>


<div class="indent">Then from the rattlesnake&#8217;s skin, with a sudden, contemptuous gesture,</div>
<div class="verse">Jerking the Indian arrows, he filled it with powder and bullets</div>
<div class="verse">Full to the very jaws, and handed it back to the savage,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, in thundering tones: &#8220;Here, take it! this is your answer!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Silently out of the room then glided the glistening savage,</div>
<div class="verse">Bearing the serpent&#8217;s skin, and seeming himself like a serpent,</div>
<div class="verse">Winding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest.</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">Just</span> in the grey of the dawn, as the mists uprose from the meadows,</div>
<div class="verse">There was a stir and a sound in the slumbering village of Plymouth;</div>
<div class="verse">Clanging and clicking of arms, and the order imperative, &#8220;Forward!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Given in tone suppressed, a tramp of feet, and then silence.</div>
<div class="verse">Figures ten, in the mist, marched slowly out of the village.</div>
<div class="verse">Standish the stalwart it was, with eight of his valorous army,</div>
<div class="verse">Led by their Indian guide, by Hobomok, friend of the white men,</div>
<div class="verse">Northward marching to quell the sudden revolt of the savage.</div>
<div class="verse">Giants they seemed in the mist, or the mighty men of King David;</div>
<div class="verse">Giants in heart they were, who believed in God and the Bible,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Ay, who believed in the smiting of Midianites and Philistines.</div>
<div class="verse">Over them gleamed far off the crimson banners of morning;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Under them loud on the sands, the serried billows, advancing,</div>
<div class="verse">Fired along the line, and in regular order retreated.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Many a mile had they marched, when at length the village of Plymouth</div>
<div class="verse">Woke from its sleep, and arose, intent on its manifold labours.</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet was the air and soft; and slowly the smoke from the chimneys</div>
<div class="verse">Rose over roofs of thatch, and pointed steadily eastward;</div>
<div class="verse">Men came forth from the doors, and paused and talked of the weather,</div>
<div class="verse">Said that the wind had changed, and was blowing fair for the May Flower;</div>
<div class="verse">Talked of their Captain&#8217;s departure, and all the dangers that menaced,</div>
<div class="verse">He being gone, the town, and what should be done in his absence.</div>
<div class="verse">Merrily sang the birds, and the tender voices of women</div>
<div class="verse">Consecrated with hymns the common cares of the household.</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the sea rose the sun, and the billows rejoiced at his coming;</div>
<div class="verse">Beautiful were his feet on the purple tops of the mountains;</div>
<div class="verse">Beautiful on the sails of the May Flower riding at anchor,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Battered and blackened and worn by all the storms of the winter.</div>
<div class="verse">Loosely against her masts was hanging and flapping her canvas,</div>
<div class="verse">Rent by so many gales, and patched by the hands of the sailors.</div>
<div class="verse">Suddenly from her side, as the sun rose over the ocean,</div>
<div class="verse">Darted a puff of smoke, and floated seaward; anon rang</div>
<div class="verse">Loud over field and forest the cannon&#8217;s roar, and the echoes</div>
<div class="verse">Heard and repeated the sound, the signal-gun of departure!</div>
<div class="verse">Ah! but with louder echoes replied the hearts of the people!</div>
<div class="verse">Meekly, in voices subdued, the chapter was read from the Bible,</div>
<div class="verse">Meekly the prayer was begun, but ended in fervent entreaty!</div>
<div class="verse">Then from their houses in haste came forth the Pilgrims of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Men and women and children, all hurrying down to the sea-shore,</div>
<div class="verse">Eager, with tearful eyes, to say farewell to the May Flower,</div>
<div class="verse">Homeward bound o&#8217;er the sea, and leaving them here in the desert.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Foremost among them was Alden. All night he had lain without slumber,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Turning and tossing about in the heat and unrest of his fever.</div>
<div class="verse">He had beheld Miles Standish, who came back late from the council,</div>
<div class="verse">Stalking into the room, and heard him mutter and murmur,</div>
<div class="verse">Sometimes it seemed a prayer, and sometimes it sounded like swearing.</div>
<div class="verse">Once he had come to the bed, and stood there a moment in silence;</div>
<div class="verse">Then he had turned away, and said: &#8220;I will not awake him;</div>
<div class="verse">Let him sleep on, it is best; for what is the use of more talking!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Then he extinguished the light, and threw himself down on his pallet,</div>
<div class="verse">Dressed as he was, and ready to start at the break of the morning,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Covered himself with the cloak he had worn in his campaigns in Flanders,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Slept as a soldier sleeps in his bivouac, ready for action.</div>
<div class="verse">But with the dawn he arose; in the twilight Alden beheld him</div>
<div class="verse">Put on his corslet of steel, and all the rest of his armour,</div>
<div class="verse">Buckle about his waist his trusty blade of Damascus,</div>
<div class="verse">Take from the corner his musket, and so stride out of the chamber.</div>
<div class="verse">Often the heart of the youth had burned and yearned to embrace him,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Often his lips had essayed to speak, imploring for pardon;</div>
<div class="verse">All the old friendship came back, with its tender and grateful emotions;</div>
<div class="verse">But his pride overmastered the nobler nature within him,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Pride, and the sense of his wrong, and the burning fire of the insult,</div>
<div class="verse">So he beheld his friend departing in anger, but spake not,</div>
<div class="verse">Saw him go forth to danger, perhaps to death, and he spake not!</div>
<div class="verse">Then he arose from his bed, and heard what the people were saying,</div>
<div class="verse">Joined in the talk at the door, with Stephen and Richard and Gilbert,</div>
<div class="verse">Joined in the morning prayer, and in the reading of Scripture,</div>
<div class="verse">And, with the others, in haste went hurrying down to the sea-shore,</div>
<div class="verse">Down to the Plymouth Rock, that had been to their feet as a door-step</div>
<div class="verse">Into a world unknown,&mdash;the corner-stone of a nation!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">There with his boat was the Master, already a little impatient</div>
<div class="verse">Lest he should lose the tide, or the wind might shift to the eastward,</div>
<div class="verse">Square-built, hearty, and strong, with an odour of ocean about him,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Speaking with this one and that, and cramming letters and parcels</div>
<div class="verse">Into his pockets capacious, and messages mingled together</div>
<div class="verse">Into his narrow brain, till at last he was wholly bewildered.</div>
<div class="verse">Nearer the boat stood Alden, with one foot placed on the gun-wale,</div>
<div class="verse">One still firm on the rock, and talking at times with the sailors,</div>
<div class="verse">Seated erect on the thwarts, all ready and eager for starting.</div>
<div class="verse">He too was eager to go, and thus put an end to his anguish,</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking to fly from despair, that swifter than keel is or canvas,</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him.</div>
<div class="verse">But as he gazed on the crowd, he beheld the form of Priscilla</div>
<div class="verse">Standing dejected among them, unconscious of all that was passing.</div>
<div class="verse">Fixed were her eyes upon his, as if she divined his intention,</div>
<div class="verse">Fixed with a look so sad, so reproachful, imploring, and patient,</div>
<div class="verse">That with a sudden revulsion his heart recoiled from its purpose,</div>
<div class="verse">As from the verge of a crag, where one step more is destruction.</div>
<div class="verse">Strange is the heart of man, with its quick, mysterious instincts!</div>

<div class="verse">Strange is the life of man, and fatal or fated are moments,</div>
<div class="verse">Whereupon turn, as on hinges, the gates of the wall adamantine!</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Here I remain!&#8221; he exclaimed, as he looked at the heavens above him,</div>
<div class="verse">Thanking the Lord whose breath had scattered the mist and the madness,</div>
<div class="verse">Wherein, blind and lost, to death he was staggering headlong.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Yonder snow-white cloud, that floats in the ether above me,</div>
<div class="verse">Seems like a hand that is pointing and beckoning over the ocean.</div>
<div class="verse">There is another hand, that is not so spectral and ghost-like,</div>
<div class="verse">Holding me, drawing me back, and clasping mine for protection.</div>
<div class="verse">Float, O hand of cloud, and vanish away in the ether!</div>
<div class="verse">Roll thyself up like a fist, to threaten and daunt me; I heed not</div>
<div class="verse">Either your warning or menace, or any omen of evil!</div>
<div class="verse">There is no land so sacred, no air so pure and so wholesome,</div>
<div class="verse">As is the air she breathes, and the soil that is pressed by her footsteps.</div>
<div class="verse">Here for her sake will I stay, and like an invisible presence</div>
<div class="verse">Hover around her for ever, protecting, supporting her weakness;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Yes! as my foot was the first that stepped on this rock at the landing,</div>
<div class="verse">So, with the blessing of God, shall it be the last at the leaving!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Meanwhile the Master alert, but with dignified air and important,</div>
<div class="verse">Scanning with watchful eye the tide and the wind and the weather,</div>
<div class="verse">Walked about on the sands; and the people crowded around him</div>
<div class="verse">Saying a few last words, and enforcing his careful remembrance.</div>
<div class="verse">Then, taking each by the hand, as if he were grasping a tiller,</div>
<div class="verse">Into the boat he sprang, and in haste shoved off to his vessel,</div>
<div class="verse">Glad in his heart to get rid of all this worry and flurry,</div>
<div class="verse">Glad to be gone from a land of sand and sickness and sorrow,</div>
<div class="verse">Short allowance of victual, and plenty of nothing but Gospel!</div>
<div class="verse">Lost in the sound of the oars was the last farewell of the Pilgrims.</div>
<div class="verse">O strong hearts and true! not one went back in the May Flower!</div>
<div class="verse">No, not one looked back, who had set his hand to this ploughing!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>


<div class="indent">Soon were heard on board the shouts and songs of the sailors</div>
<div class="verse">Heaving the windlass round, and hoisting the ponderous anchor.</div>
<div class="verse">Then the yards were braced, and all sails set to the west-wind,</div>
<div class="verse">Blowing steady and strong; and the May Flower sailed from the harbour,</div>
<div class="verse">Rounded the point of the Gurnet, and leaving far to the southward</div>
<div class="verse">Island and cape of sand, and the Field of the First Encounter,</div>
<div class="verse">Took the wind on her quarter, and stood for the open Atlantic,</div>
<div class="verse">Borne on the send of the sea, and the swelling hearts of the Pilgrims.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Long in silence they watched the receding sail of the vessel,</div>
<div class="verse">Much endeared to them all, as something living and human;</div>
<div class="verse">Then, as if filled with the spirit, and wrapt in a vision prophetic,</div>
<div class="verse">Baring his hoary head, the excellent Elder of Plymouth</div>
<div class="verse">Said, &#8220;Let us pray!&#8221; and they prayed, and thanked the Lord and took courage.</div>
<div class="verse">Mournfully sobbed the waves at the base of the rock, and above them</div>
<div class="verse">Bowed and whispered the wheat on the hill of death, and their kindred</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Seemed to awake in their graves, and to join in the prayer that they uttered.</div>
<div class="verse">Sun-illumined and white, on the eastern verge of the ocean</div>
<div class="verse">Gleamed the departing sail, like a marble slab in a graveyard;</div>
<div class="verse">Buried beneath it lay for ever all hope of escaping.</div>
<div class="verse">Lo! as they turned to depart, they saw the form of an Indian,</div>
<div class="verse">Watching them from the hill; but while they spake with each other,</div>
<div class="verse">Pointing with outstretched hands, and saying, &#8220;Look!&#8221; he had vanished.</div>
<div class="verse">So they returned to their homes; but Alden lingered a little,</div>
<div class="verse">Musing alone on the shore, and watching the wash of the billows</div>
<div class="verse">Round the base of the rock, and the sparkle and flash of the sunshine,</div>
<div class="verse">Like the spirit of God, moving visibly over the waters.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">Thus</span> for a while he stood, and mused by the shore of the ocean,</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking of many things, and most of all of Priscilla;</div>
<div class="verse">And as if thought had the power to draw to itself, like the loadstone,</div>
<div class="verse">Whatsoever it touches, by subtle laws of its nature,</div>
<div class="verse">Lo! as he turned to depart, Priscilla was standing beside him.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">&#8220;Are you so much offended, you will not speak to me?&#8221; said she.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Am I so much to blame, that yesterday when you were pleading</div>
<div class="verse">Warmly the cause of another, my heart, impulsive and wayward,</div>
<div class="verse">Pleaded your own, and spake out, forgetful perhaps of decorum?</div>
<div class="verse">Certainly you can forgive me for speaking so frankly, for saying</div>
<div class="verse">What I ought not to have said, yet now I can never unsay it;</div>
<div class="verse">For there are moments in life, when the heart is so full of emotion,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
<div class="verse">That if by chance it be shaken, or into its depths like a pebble</div>
<div class="verse">Drops some careless word, it overflows, and its secret,</div>
<div class="verse">Spilt on the ground like water, can never be gathered together.</div>
<div class="verse">Yesterday I was shocked, when I heard you speak of Miles Standish,</div>
<div class="verse">Praising his virtues, transforming his very defects into virtues,</div>
<div class="verse">Praising his courage and strength, and even his fighting in Flanders,</div>
<div class="verse">As if by fighting alone you could win the heart of a woman,</div>
<div class="verse">Quite overlooking yourself and the rest, in exalting your hero.</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore I spake as I did, by an irresistible impulse.</div>
<div class="verse">You will forgive me, I hope, for the sake of the friendship between us,</div>
<div class="verse">Which is too true and too sacred to be so easily broken!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered John Alden, the scholar, the friend of Miles Standish:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I was not angry with you, with myself alone I was angry.</div>
<div class="verse">Seeing how badly I managed the matter I had in my keeping.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;No!&#8221; interrupted the maiden, with answer prompt and decisive;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;No; you were angry with me, for speaking so frankly and freely.</div>

<div class="verse">It was wrong, I acknowledge; for it is the fate of a woman</div>
<div class="verse">Long to be patient and silent, to wait like a ghost that is speechless,</div>
<div class="verse">Till some questioning voice dissolves the spell of its silence.</div>
<div class="verse">Hence is the inner life of so many suffering women</div>
<div class="verse">Sunless and silent and deep, like subterranean rivers</div>
<div class="verse">Running through caverns of darkness, unheard, unseen, and unfruitful,</div>
<div class="verse">Chafing their channels of stone, with endless and profitless murmurs.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered John Alden, the young man, the lover of women:</div>

<div class="verse">More like the beautiful rivers that watered the garden of Eden,</div>
<div class="verse">More like the river Euphrates, through deserts of Havilah flowing,</div>
<div class="verse">Filling the land with delight, and memories sweet of the garden!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Ah, by these words, I can see,&#8221; again interrupted the maiden.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;How very little you prize me, or care for what I am saying.</div>

<div class="verse">Straightway you take up my words, that are plain and direct and in earnest,</div>
<div class="verse">Turn them away from their meaning, and answer with flattering phrases.</div>
<div class="verse">This is not right, is not just, is not true to the best that is in you;</div>
<div class="verse">For I know and esteem you, and feel that your nature is noble,</div>
<div class="verse">Lifting mine up to a higher, a more ethereal level.</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore I value your friendship, and feel it perhaps the more keenly</div>
<div class="verse">If you say aught that implies I am only as one among many,</div>
<div class="verse">If you make use of those common and complimentary phrases</div>
<div class="verse">Most men think so fine, in dealing and speaking with women,</div>
<div class="verse">But which women reject as insipid, if not as insulting.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Mute and amazed was Alden; and listened and looked at Priscilla,</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking he never had seen her more fair, more divine in her beauty,</div>
<div class="verse">He who but yesterday pleaded so glibly the cause of another,</div>
<div class="verse">Stood there embarrassed and silent, and seeking in vain for an answer.</div>
<div class="verse">So the maiden went on, and little divined or imagined</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
<div class="verse">What was at work in his heart, that made him so awkward and speechless.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Let us, then, be what we are, and speak what we think, and in all things</div>
<div class="verse">Keep ourselves loyal to truth, and the sacred professions of friendship.</div>
<div class="verse">It is no secret I tell you, nor am I ashamed to declare it:</div>
<div class="verse">I have liked to be with you, to see you, to speak with you always.</div>
<div class="verse">So I was hurt at your words, and a little affronted to hear you</div>
<div class="verse">Urge me to marry your friend, though he were the Captain Miles Standish.</div>
<div class="verse">For I must tell you the truth: much more to me is your friendship</div>
<div class="verse">Than all the love he could give, were he twice the hero you think him.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Then she extended her hand, and Alden, who eagerly grasped it,</div>
<div class="verse">Felt all the wounds in his heart, that were aching and bleeding so sorely,</div>
<div class="verse">Healed by the touch of that hand, and he said with a voice full of feeling:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Yes, we must ever be friends; and of all who offer you friendship</div>
<div class="verse">Let me be ever the first, the truest, the nearest and dearest!&#8221;</div>

<div class="indent">Casting a farewell look at the glimmering sail of the May Flower,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Distant, but still in sight, and sinking below the horizon,</div>
<div class="verse">Homeward together they walked, with a strange, indefinite feeling,</div>
<div class="verse">That all the rest had departed and left them alone in the desert.</div>
<div class="verse">But, as they went through the fields in the blessing and smile of the sunshine,</div>
<div class="verse">Lighter grew their hearts, and Priscilla said very archly:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Now that our terrible Captain has gone in pursuit of the Indians,</div>
<div class="verse">Where he is happier far than he would be commanding a household,</div>
<div class="verse">You may speak boldly, and tell me of all that happened between you,</div>
<div class="verse">When you returned last night, and said how ungrateful you found me.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered John Alden, and told her the whole of the story,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Told her his own despair, and the direful wrath of Miles Standish.</div>
<div class="verse">Whereat the maiden smiled, and said between laughing and earnest,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;He is a little chimney, and heated hot in a moment!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">But as he gently rebuked her, and told her how much he had suffered,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">How he had even determined to sail that day in the May Flower,</div>
<div class="verse">And had remained for her sake, on hearing the dangers that threatened,&mdash;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
<div class="verse">All her manner was changed, and she said with a faltering accent,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Truly I thank you for this: how good you have been to me always!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Thus as a pilgrim devout, who toward Jerusalem journeys,</div>
<div class="verse">Taking three steps in advance, and one reluctantly backward,</div>

THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH.</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> the stalwart Miles Standish was marching steadily northward,</div>
<div class="verse">Winding through forest and swamp, and along the trend of the sea-shore,</div>
<div class="verse">All day long, with hardly a halt, the fire of his anger</div>
<div class="verse">Burning and crackling within, and the sulphurous odour of powder</div>
<div class="verse">Seeming more sweet to his nostrils than all the scents of the forest.</div>
<div class="verse">Silent and moody he went, and much he revolved his discomfort;</div>
<div class="verse">He who was used to success, and to easy victories always,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus to be flouted, rejected, and laughed to scorn by a maiden,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus to be mocked and betrayed by the friend whom most he had trusted!</div>
<div class="verse">Ah! &#8217;twas too much to be borne, and he fretted and chafed in his armour!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">&#8220;I alone am to blame,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;for mine was the folly.</div>
<div class="verse">What has a rough old soldier, grown grim and grey in the harness,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Used to the camp and its ways, to do with the wooing of maidens?</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas but a dream,&mdash;let it pass,&mdash;let it vanish like so many others!</div>
<div class="verse">What I thought was a flower, is only a weed, and is worthless;</div>
<div class="verse">Out of my heart will I pluck it, and throw it away, and henceforward</div>
<div class="verse">Be but a fighter of battles, a lover and wooer of dangers!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Thus he revolved in his mind his sorry defeat and discomfort,</div>
<div class="verse">While he was marching by day or lying at night in the forest,</div>
<div class="verse">Looking up at the trees, and the constellations beyond them.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">After a three days&#8217; march he came to an Indian encampment</div>
<div class="verse">Pitched on the edge of a meadow, between the sea and the forest;</div>
<div class="verse">Women at work by the tents, and the warriors, horrid with war-paint,</div>
<div class="verse">Seated about a fire, and smoking and talking together;</div>
<div class="verse">Who, when they saw from afar the sudden approach of the white men,</div>
<div class="verse">Saw the flash of the sun on breastplate and sabre and musket,</div>
<div class="verse">Straightway leaped to their feet, and two, from among them advancing,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Came to parley with Standish, and offer him furs as a present;</div>
<div class="verse">Friendship was in their looks, but in their hearts there was hatred.</div>
<div class="verse">Braves of the tribe were these, and brothers gigantic in stature,</div>
<div class="verse">Huge as Goliath of Gath, or the terrible Og, king of Bashan;</div>
<div class="verse">One was Pecksuot named, and the other was called Wattawamat.</div>
<div class="verse">Round their necks were suspended their knives in scabbards of wampum,</div>
<div class="verse">Two-edged, trenchant knives, with points as sharp as a needle.</div>
<div class="verse">Other arms had they none, for they were cunning and crafty.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Welcome, English!&#8221; they said,&mdash;these words they had learned from the traders</div>
<div class="verse">Touching at times on the coast, to barter and chaffer for peltries.</div>
<div class="verse">Then in their native tongue they began to parley with Standish,</div>
<div class="verse">Through his guide and interpreter, Hobomok, friend of the white man,</div>
<div class="verse">Begging for blankets and knives, but mostly for muskets and powder,</div>
<div class="verse">Kept by the white man, they said, concealed, with the plague, in his cellars,</div>
<div class="verse">Ready to be let loose, and destroy his brother the red man!</div>
<div class="verse">But when Standish refused, and said he would give them the Bible,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Suddenly changing their tone, they began to boast and to bluster.</div>
<div class="verse">Then Wattawamat advanced with a stride in front of the other,</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_090.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And, with a lofty demeanour, thus vauntingly spake to the Captain:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Now Wattawamat can see, by the fiery eyes of the Captain,</div>
<div class="verse">Angry is he in his heart; but the heart of the brave Wattawamat</div>
<div class="verse">Is not afraid at the sight. He was not born of a woman,</div>
<div class="verse">But on a mountain, at night, from an oaktree riven by lightning,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Forth he sprang at a bound, with all his weapons about him,</div>
<div class="verse">Shouting, &#8216;Who is there here to fight with the brave Wattawamat?&#8217;&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Then he unsheathed his knife, and, whetting the blade on his left hand,</div>
<div class="verse">Held it aloft and displayed a woman&#8217;s face on the handle,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, with bitter expression and look of sinister meaning:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I have another at home, with the face of a man on the handle;</div>
<div class="verse">By and by they shall marry; and there will be plenty of children!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Then stood Pecksuot forth, self-vaunting, insulting Miles Standish:</div>
<div class="verse">While with his fingers he patted the knife that hung at his bosom,</div>
<div class="verse">Drawing it half from its sheath, and plunging it back, as he muttered,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;By and by it shall see; it shall eat; ah, ha! but shall speak not!</div>
<div class="verse">This is the mighty Captain the white men have sent to destroy us!</div>
<div class="verse">He is a little man; let him go and work with the women!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Meanwhile Standish had noted the faces and figures of Indians</div>
<div class="verse">Peeping and creeping about from bush to tree in the forest,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Feigning to look for game, with arrows set on their bow-strings,</div>
<div class="verse">Drawing about him still closer and closer the net of their ambush.</div>
<div class="verse">But undaunted he stood, and dissembled and treated them smoothly;</div>
<div class="verse">So the old chronicles say, that were writ in the days of the fathers.</div>
<div class="verse">But when he heard their defiance, the boast, the taunt, and the insult,</div>
<div class="verse">All the hot blood of his race, of Sir Hugh and of Thurston de Standish,</div>
<div class="verse">Boiled and beat in his heart, and swelled in the veins of his temples.</div>
<div class="verse">Headlong he leaped on the boaster, and, snatching his knife from its scabbard,</div>
<div class="verse">Plunged it into his heart, and, reeling backward, the savage</div>
<div class="verse">Fell with his face to the sky, and a fiendlike fierceness upon it.</div>
<div class="verse">Straight there arose from the forest the awful sound of the warwhoop,</div>
<div class="verse">And, like a flurry of snow on the whistling wind of December,</div>
<div class="verse">Swift and sudden and keen came a flight of feathery arrows.</div>
<div class="verse">Then came a cloud of smoke, and out of the cloud came the lightning,</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the lightning thunder; and death unseen ran before it.</div>
<div class="verse">Frightened the savages fled for shelter in swamp and in thicket,</div>

<div class="verse">Passed through his brain, and he fell with both hands clutching the greensward,</div>
<div class="verse">Seeming in death to hold back from his foe the land of his fathers.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">There on the flowers of the meadow the warriors lay, and above them,</div>

<div class="verse">&#8220;Pecksuot bragged very loud of his courage, his strength and his stature,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Mocked the great Captain, and called him a little man; but I see now</div>

<div class="verse">Busy with breaking the glebe, and mowing the grass in the meadows,</div>

<div class="verse">Bravely the stalwart Miles Standish was scouring the land with his forces,</div>
<div class="verse">Waxing valiant in fight and defeating the alien armies,</div>

<div class="verse">Mingled with pain and regret, unconscious of what he was doing,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Clasped, almost with a groan, the motionless form of Priscilla,</div>
<div class="verse">Pressing her close to his heart, as for ever his own, and exclaiming:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Those whom the Lord hath united, let no man put them asunder!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Even as rivulets twain, from distant and separate sources,</div>
<div class="verse">Seeing each other afar, as they leap from the rocks, and pursuing</div>
<div class="verse">Each one its devious path, but drawing nearer and nearer,</div>
<div class="verse">Rush together at last, at their trysting-place in the forest;</div>
<div class="verse">So these lives that had run thus far in separate channels,</div>
<div class="verse">Coming in sight of each other, then swerving and flowing asunder,</div>
<div class="verse">Parted by barriers strong, but drawing nearer and nearer,</div>
<div class="verse">Rushed together at last, and one was lost in the other.</div>

<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">Forth</span> from the curtain of clouds, from the tent of purple and scarlet,</div>
<div class="verse">Issued the sun, the great High-Priest, in his garments resplendent,</div>
<div class="verse">Holiness unto the Lord, in letters of light, on his forehead,</div>
<div class="verse">Round the hem of his robe the golden bells and pomegranates.</div>
<div class="verse">Blessing the world he came, and the bars of vapour beneath him</div>
<div class="verse">Gleamed like a grate of brass, and the sea at his feet was a laver!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">This was the wedding morn of Priscilla the Puritan maiden.</div>
<div class="verse">Friends were assembled together; the Elder and Magistrate also</div>
<div class="verse">Graced the scene with their presence, and stood like the Law and the Gospel,</div>
<div class="verse">One with the sanction of earth and one with the blessing of heaven.</div>
<div class="verse">Simple and brief was the wedding, as that of Ruth and of Boaz.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Softly the youth and the maiden repeated the words of betrothal,</div>
<div class="verse">Taking each other for husband and wife in the Magistrate&#8217;s presence,</div>
<div class="verse">After the Puritan way, and the laudable custom of Holland.</div>
<div class="verse">Fervently then, and devoutly, the excellent Elder of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Prayed for the hearth and the home, that were founded that day in affection,</div>
<div class="verse">Speaking of life and of death, and imploring divine benedictions.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Lo! when the service was ended, a form appeared on the threshold,</div>
<div class="verse">Clad in armour of steel, a sombre and sorrowful figure!</div>
<div class="verse">Why does the bridegroom start and stare at the strange apparition?</div>
<div class="verse">Why does the bride turn pale, and hide her face on his shoulder?</div>
<div class="verse">Is it a phantom of air,&mdash;a bodiless, spectral illusion?</div>
<div class="verse">Is it a ghost from the grave, that has come to forbid the betrothal?</div>
<div class="verse">Long had it stood there unseen, a guest uninvited, unwelcomed;</div>
<div class="verse">Over its clouded eyes there had passed at times an expression</div>
<div class="verse">Softening the gloom and revealing the warm heart hidden beneath them,</div>

<div class="verse">As when across the sky the driving rack of the rain-cloud</div>
<div class="verse">Grows for a moment thin, and betrays the sun by its brightness.</div>
<div class="verse">Once it had lifted its hand, and moved its lips, but was silent,</div>
<div class="verse">As if an iron will had mastered the fleeting intention.</div>
<div class="verse">But when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last benediction,</div>
<div class="verse">Into the room it strode, and the people beheld with amazement</div>
<div class="verse">Bodily there in his armour Miles Standish, the Captain of Plymouth!</div>
<div class="verse">Grasping the bridegroom&#8217;s hand, he said with emotion, &#8220;Forgive me!</div>
<div class="verse">I have been angry and hurt,&mdash;too long have I cherished the feeling;</div>
<div class="verse">I have been cruel and hard, but now, thank God! it is ended.</div>
<div class="verse">Mine is the same hot blood that leaped in the veins of Hugh Standish,</div>
<div class="verse">Sensitive, swift to resent, but as swift in atoning for error.</div>
<div class="verse">Never so much as now was Miles Standish the friend of John Alden.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered the bridegroom: &#8220;Let all be forgotten between us,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">All save the dear, old friendship, and that shall grow older and dearer!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Then the Captain advanced, and, bowing, saluted Priscilla,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Gravely and after the manner of old-fashioned gentry in England,</div>
<div class="verse">Something of camp and of court, of town and of country, commingled,</div>
<div class="verse">Wishing her joy of her wedding, and loudly lauding her husband.</div>
<div class="verse">Then he said with a smile: &#8220;I should have remembered the adage,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">If you would be well served, you must serve yourself; and moreover,</div>
<div class="verse">No man can gather cherries in Kent at the season of Christmas!&#8221;</div>

<div class="poetry">

<div class="indent">Great was the people&#8217;s amazement, and greater yet their rejoicing,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus to behold once more the sun-burnt face of their Captain,</div>
<div class="verse">Whom they had mourned as dead; and they gathered and crowded about him,</div>
<div class="verse">Eager to see him and hear him, forgetful of bride and of bridegroom,</div>
<div class="verse">Questioning, answering, laughing, and each interrupting the other.</div>
<div class="verse">Till the good Captain declared, being quite overpowered and bewildered,</div>
<div class="verse">He had rather by far break into an Indian encampment,</div>
<div class="verse">Than come again to a wedding to which he had not been invited.</div>
<div class="verse">Meanwhile the bridegroom went forth and stood with the bride at the doorway,</div>
<div class="verse">Breathing the perfumed air of that warm and beautiful morning.</div>
<div class="verse">Touched with autumnal tints, but lonely and sad in the sunshine,</div>
<div class="verse">Lay extended before them the land of toil and privation;</div>
<div class="verse">There were the graves of the dead, and the barren waste of the sea-shore,</div>
<div class="verse">There the familiar fields, the groves of pine, and the meadows;</div>
<div class="verse">But to their eyes transfigured, it seemed as the Garden of Eden,</div>
<div class="verse">Filled with the presence of God, whose voice was the sound of the ocean.</div>

<div class="verse">Friends coming forth from the house, and impatient of longer delaying,</div>
<div class="verse">Each with his plan for the day, and the work that was left uncompleted.</div>
<div class="verse">Then from a stall near at hand, amid exclamations of wonder,</div>
<div class="verse">Alden the thoughtful, the careful, so happy, so proud of Priscilla,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Brought out his snow-white steer, obeying the hand of its master,</div>
<div class="verse">Led by a cord that was tied to an iron ring in its nostrils,</div>
<div class="verse">Covered with crimson cloth, and a cushion placed for a saddle.</div>
<div class="verse">She should not walk, he said, through the dust and heat of the noonday;</div>
<div class="verse">Nay, she should ride like a queen, not plod along like a peasant.</div>
<div class="verse">Somewhat alarmed at first, but reassured by the others,</div>
<div class="verse">Placing her hand on the cushion, her foot in the hand of her husband,</div>
<div class="verse">Gayly, with joyous laugh, Priscilla mounted her palfrey.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Nothing is wanting now,&#8221; he said with a smile, &#8220;but the distaff;</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Onward the bridal procession now moved to their new habitation,</div>
<div class="verse">Happy husband and wife, and friends conversing together.</div>
<div class="verse">Pleasantly murmured the brook, as they crossed the ford in the forest,</div>
<div class="verse">Pleased with the image that passed, like a dream of love through its bosom,</div>

<div class="verse">Wild and sweet as the clusters that grew in the valley of Eshcol.</div>
<div class="verse">Like a picture it seemed of the primitive, pastoral ages,</div>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
